## Bioinformatics / Metabolomics Software

The P2M2 Central Hub serves as the centralized gateway to the dematerialized tools developed by the P2M2 metabolomics platform 

### Online Tools for Manipulating File Formats in Metabolomics

- [General statistics for MGF mascot files containing MS/MS data. Detection of co-eluted MS features.](https://p2m2.github.io/mgf-p2m2-tools/)
- [Identifying Common Ions of Interest Across XCMS Files.](https://p2m2.github.io/xcms-p2m2-tools/)

### Online Isotopic Tools

- [Corrective method dedicated to Isocor for calculating carbon isotopologue distribution from GCMS runs.](https://p2m2.github.io/ihm-githubio-gcms2isocor/)
- [Calculations of 13C-Positional Enrichments](https://p2m2.github.io/positional-carbon13-enrichment/). Positional 13C-enrichments were calculated by combining mean 13C-enrichments of multiple fragments that shared part of the same carbon backbone.

### Software Development in Metabolomics

- [Oligopeptides Matching.](https://p2m2.shinyapps.io/oligopeptides_matching/) 
- [mzxml-glucosinolate-analyser](https://github.com/p2m2/mzxml-glucosinolate-analyser): Ion detection suitable for characterizing glucosinolate and phenolic metabolites, as described in [Identification and Quantification of Glucosinolates and Phenolics in a Large Panel of Brassica napus, Highlighting Valuable Genetic Resources for Chemical Ecology and Breeding](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08118).

### Spark / Datalake Software Development

- [stream-reader-mzxml](https://github.com/p2m2/stream-reader-mzxml): A Scala library specializing in stream processing of mzXML files, based on FS2.


## APIÂ Services tools

- [service-p2m2tools-api](https://github.com/p2m2/service-p2m2tools-api). Service to parse the formats of the metabolomics data acquisition devices of the P2M2 platform 

## Web Semantic

### Development of APIs for Data Accessibility in Open Science

- [Discovery](https://github.com/p2m2/discovery): Discovery provides a powerful toolset for developers who are looking to build UIs using RDF data in a robust software development process.

## RDF on a Spark Datalake

- [Sansa RDF Tutorial: Harnessing RDF in a Spark Datalake](https://p2m2.github.io/tp-big-data-scala-spark-sansa/)
- [Integration and Exploitation of Knowledge Graphs in Metabolomics on a Distributed Big Data Architecture](https://unh-pfem-gitlab.ara.inrae.fr/metabosemdatalake/msd-database-management)
