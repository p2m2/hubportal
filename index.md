## Bioinformatics / Metabolomics Software

### Online Tools for Manipulating File Formats in Metabolomics

- [General statistics for MGF mascot files containing MS/MS data. Detection of co-eluted MS features.](https://p2m2.github.io/mgf-p2m2-tools/)
- [Identifying Common Ions of Interest Across XCMS Files.](https://p2m2.github.io/xcms-p2m2-tools/)

### Online Isotopic Tools

- [Corrective method dedicated to Isocor for calculating carbon isotopologue distribution from GCMS runs.](https://p2m2.github.io/ihm-githubio-gcms2isocor/)
- [Calculations of 13C-Positional Enrichments](https://p2m2.github.io/positional-carbon13-enrichment/). Positional 13C-enrichments were calculated by combining mean 13C-enrichments of multiple fragments that shared part of the same carbon backbone.

### Software Development in Metabolomics

- [Oligopeptides Matching.](https://p2m2.shinyapps.io/oligopeptides_matching/) 
- [mzxml-glucosinolate-analyser](https://github.com/p2m2/mzxml-glucosinolate-analyser): Ion detection eligible for the characterization of glucosinolate and phenolic metabolites. 
- [Identification and Quantification of Glucosinolates and Phenolics in a Large Panel of Brassica napus Highlight Valuable Genetic Resources for Chemical Ecology and Breeding.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08118)

### Spark / Datalake software development

[stream-reader-mzxml](https://github.com/p2m2/stream-reader-mzxml). A Scala library specializing in stream processing of mzXML files, based on FS2.

## API Services tools

- [service-p2m2tools-api](https://github.com/p2m2/service-p2m2tools-api). Service to parse the formats of the metabolomics data acquisition devices of the P2M2 platform 

## Web Semantic

### Development of APIs for Data Accessibility in Open Science

- [Discovery](https://github.com/p2m2/discovery): Discovery provides a powerful toolset for developers who are looking to build UIs using RDF data in a robust software development process.
